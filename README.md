# Motion Detection Player

![Alt text](./screenShot.png "Player")

### Description

This is a motion detection app that uses handtrack.js. Once the video in the upper-left corner of the page is loaded, the app will detect hand motions and move the circle depending on where your hand is. If the circle is hovering over one of the "keys" the key will turn blue and a note will play.
